I am a senior postdoctoral research fellow at the UCL [Insititute of Ophthalmology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/) in the Ocular Genomics and Therapeutics group of Professor Mariya Moosajee.

My research focuses on the molecular and cellular biology of rare diseases. Investigating the biological mechanisms involved in the genetic disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), I developed an interest in RNA splicing and disease. My work developed and optimised an antisense based method to modulate the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts as a therapy for patients.

Since then, I have been engaged in a several research projects involving RNA splicing defects, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Alzheimer's Disease. I have continued my interests in improving our understanding of rare diseases through transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenetic and whole genome data analysis. With a honorary research position at Moorfields Eye Hospital I have been fortunate to investigate several genetic ocular disorders and utilise the wealth of clinical information to enhance the analysis of patient transcriptome and whole genome sequence data.
