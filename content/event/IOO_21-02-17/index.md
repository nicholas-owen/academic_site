abstract: "Omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have revolutionized our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex rare diseases, including those of the eye. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the latest advances in omics analysis of eye diseases and their clinical implications, focused on increasing diagnostic rates.


The integration of multi-omics data has allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular pathways in eye diseases. For instance, the integration of genomic and transcriptomic data has identified novel genes and pathways associated with eye disease. The clinical implications of omics analysis of eye diseases are significant, including the development of personalized medicine approaches and the identification of new drug targets. Additionally, omics analysis has the potential to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of eye diseases, leading to more effective treatments and improved outcomes for patients."
