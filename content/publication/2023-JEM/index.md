abstract: "Homeobox-containing transcription factor *PAX6* is a key regulator of eye development. Pathogenic heterozygous *PAX6* variants lead to variable ocular phenotypes, notably aniridia, typically resulting from haploinsufficiency. Missense variants are often associated with milder phenotypes, however mutations in the DNA-binding paired domain lead to severe ocular phenotypes including microphthalmia, but precise molecular targets are poorly understood. hiPSC derived 3D optic vesicles were generated from patients with variants (i) PAX6<sup>N124K</sup> displaying combined microphthalmia, aniridia and optic nerve coloboma, and (ii) PAX6<sup>R261X</sup> exhibiting typical aniridia. Total RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptomic differences between samples, including downregulation of Notch signalling components in missense PAX6<sup>N124K</sup> vesicles. Significant reduction in expression of Notch regulator SOX2 in retinal progenitor cells suggests altered DNA-binding by PAX6<sup>N124K</sup>. This misregulation of SOX2-mediated Notch signalling perturbs retinal progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Our molecular analysis of in vitro models of *PAX6*-related oculopathies provides novel insights into *PAX6* regulation of eye development and new potential disease mechanisms which elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Investigation of the molecular pathology of oculogenesis regulator, PAX6, through patient-derived hiPSC optic vesicles with (i) haploinsufficiency-related aniridia and (ii) missense-associated microphthalmia. Transcriptomic analysis reveals variant-specific disruption to SOX2-mediated Notch-signalling perturbing proliferation and differentiation, uncovering a mechanism for PAX6-associated microphthalmia."
