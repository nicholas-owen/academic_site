abstract: "Purpose: Mutations in the ciliary transporter gene IFT140, usually associated with a severe syndromic ciliopathy, may also cause isolated retinal dystrophy. A series of patients with nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) due to IFT140 was investigated in this study.

Methods: Five probands and available affected family members underwent detailed phenotyping including retinal imaging and electrophysiology. Whole exome sequencing was performed on two probands, a targeted sequencing panel of 176 retinal genes on a further two, and whole genome sequencing on the fifth. Missense mutations of IFT140 were further investigated in vitro using transient plasmid transfection of hTERT-RPE1 cells.

Results: Eight affected patients from five families had preserved visual acuity until at least the second decade; all had normal development without skeletal manifestations or renal failure at age 13 to 67 years (mean, 42 years; median, 44.5 years). Bi-allelic mutations in IFT140 were identified in all families including two novel mutations: c.2815T > C (p.Ser939Pro) and c.1422_23insAA (p.Arg475Asnfs*14). Expression studies demonstrated a significantly reduced number of cells showing localization of mutant IFT140 with the basal body for two nonsyndromic mutations and two syndromic mutations compared with the wild type and a polymorphism.

Conclusions: This study highlights the phenotype of nonsyndromic RP due to mutations in IFT140 with milder retinal dystrophy than that associated with the syndromic disease."
